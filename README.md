# Combine ALMA, ACA and TP observations
### Introduction
This repository documents my workflow and scripts for combining ALMA single-dish and interferometric observations.
The main processing follows the [ALMICA](https://github.com/baobabyoo/almica). 

### Requirement
- CASA (mainly for exporting MS)   
- Miriad (mainly for combination)   
- CARTA (for image visualization)


### Reflection
I did not enjoy processing the data :)
